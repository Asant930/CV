        <p><em>Learning Coder for the <strong>MERN</strong> stack</em></p>
        <p>I started my interest in coding after being out of work for a period of time from something. I think you can guess
          what
          that something was. My background is Restaurants and Hospitality Management along with Accounting. Being out of work I
          thought a lot about what I could do instead. Coding peaked my interest when looking at different career paths. I
          started
          with Codecademy and went from there. I eventually enrolled in the MIT Full-Stack Development coding course! I am
          really
          enjoying the time spent learning something new and hope to get better as time goes on. If you want to see more of my
          non
          IT background you can visit my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-santelli/" target="blank">LinkedIn</a>. You
          can see my Repositories here on my <a href="https://github.com/Asant930" target="blank">Github page</a>. If you would
